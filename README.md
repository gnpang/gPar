# gPar - A Python-Based toolbox for array processing

gPar was designed to perform array processing techniques described at Rost and Thomas (2002).

Rost, S., & Thomas, C. Array seismology: Methods and applications. Rev. Geophys. 40(3), 2-1 (2002).

gPar is still in development and contains bugs. New array processing techniques are adding in gPar either.
Therefore, it should be used with caution

# Installation
This code is written for python 3.7. Since Basemap toolkit is expiring in higher version of python 3.8, it may have problem running this code in python 3.8 or higher.

Dependencies:
  
  1. Obspy v1.1.1 – for processing seismic waveforms
  2. pandas v0.24.2 or higher
  3. numpy
  4. scipy
  5. PyQt5 – for GUI postprocessing 

Install

User can install gPar by pip install git+https://github.com/gnpang/gPar

or from the download the source package then type pythin setup.py install

# Tuitorial

There is a Tuitorial to walk through the processing in gPar.
